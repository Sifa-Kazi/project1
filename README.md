Project:- HR Analytics – Employee Attrition

Objective:

Analyze employee data to identify key factors influencing attrition and predict future resignations.

Dataset:

IBM HR Employee Attrition Dataset

Steps Performed:

•	Data cleaning & preprocessing (remove unnecessary columns, encode categoricals, scale numerics)

•	EDA: overall attrition, department-wise attrition, monthly income vs attrition, overtime impact

•	Model: Logistic Regression with class imbalance handling

•	Evaluation: accuracy ~84%, confusion matrix, classification report

•	Explainability: SHAP analysis to identify key features

•	Visualization: multi-page Power BI dashboard with KPIs and charts

Tools:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Power BI

Output:

Trained model, accuracy report, SHAP plots, Power BI dashboard, attrition prevention insights
